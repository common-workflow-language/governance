Conservancy Welcomes the Common Workflow Language as a Member Project

<p>Software Freedom Conservancy proudly welcomes the <a href="http://www.commonwl.org/index.html">Common Workflow Language project</a> (CWL) as Conservancy's newest member project. 
CWL is a specification for describing data analysis workflows and tools in 
a way that makes them portable and scalable across a variety of software 
and hardware environments.</p>

<p>Conservancy, a public charity focused on ethical technology, is the home 
of over forty member projects dedicated to developing free and open source 
software.  Conservancy acts as a corporate umbrella, allowing member 
projects to operate as charitable initiatives without having to 
independently manage their own corporate structure and administrative 
services.</p>

<p>FIXME-QUOTE (why CWL is joining Conservancy)</p>

<p>"We're excited to have the Common Workflow Language project join Conservancy,"
said Karen M. Sandler, Conservancy's Executive Director.  "CWL is solving
important problems that will make collaborating on big data analysis 
easier.  We're proud to support CWL in their efforts."</p>

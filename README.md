# Contacting the CWL leadership team & Conservancy

commonworkflowlanguage@sfconservancy.org simultaneously contacts Conservancy *and* the CWL leadership team.

This address should be CC'ed regarding all activities that involve
activities of Common Workflow Language that related to things other than
software development and documentation, and particularly any activities
that expect to make use of Software Freedom Conservancy's non-profit
status.  Conservancy folks will often CC that address any time there is
an issue that Conservancy wants to make sure the project is aware.

To update any of the email addresses on this list, the CWL project leader should email sysadmin@tix.sfconservancy.org with 
`commonworkflowlanguage@sfconservancy.org` in the CC field.

# Contacting just the CWL leadership team

cwl-leadership@googlegroups.com

# Finances

CWL leadership team members can email
<commonworkflowlanguage@sfconservancy.org> to request reports on our
funds in Conservancy funds, or ask questions about the existing balance
and/or expenses. 

When one has project expenses that should be
reimbursed or paid, please send (or ask the reimbursement-seeker to
send) the full details to <accounts-payable@tix.sfconservancy.org>.  If
the expense hasn't already been approved by the project, and/or Accounts
Payable hasn't been given a copy of that approval, CC'ing
<commonworkflowlanguage@sfconservancy.org> on the request is a good idea.

# Records held at Conservancy

Conservancy stores records on behalf of CWL which are managed via subversion. The are primarily legal and financial records.
Included is the Fiscal Sponsorship Agreement, and copies of grant proposals. This is also where the Ledger file is located.
The Ledger records all of the money going in or out of CWLâ€™s fund. It has all the supporting documentation for those records:
invoices Conservancy sends out on behalf of CWL, expense reports and receipts for expenses, etc.

Access to these records is available to any member of the CWL leadership team.

# Policy on requesting and/or acquiring grants/funding related to the CWL Project

## Policy

It is a requirement of the CWL fiscal sponsor, Software Freedom Conservancy (SFC),
that all applications by any entity for
1) **funding** of the CWL project's work or
2) **funding** in the name of the CWL project
must be submitted by SFC **unless** an agreement otherwise has been approved by
both the CWL Project Leadership Team and SFC.

Submitting grants and/or getting funding to do the work of the CWL
Project (or otherwise in the name of or on-behalf of the CWL Project) without
approval from SFC and the CWL Leadership Team can result in cancellation of
sustaining/support member status (without refund), censure, and/or other
consequences as deemed appropriate by SFC and the CWL Leadership Team.

Proposals for implementations (or enhancements of implementations) of the CWL
Standards do not need approval, unless it is of the CWL reference implementation
(`cwltool`).

Proposing work related to any of the CWL GitHub organizations is a sign that
approval **is needed**.
- <https://github.com/common-workflow-language>
- <https://github.com/common-workflow-lab>
- <https://github.com/common-workflow-library>

If there is doubt about what constitutes "the work of the CWL project", please
ask the CWL Leadership Team directly.

## Motivation

CWL is a member project of Software Freedom Conservancy, Inc. As per the
[membership agreement signed by all members of the initial CWL project
leadership
team](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/governance/blob/ddb07b99ae62006f70cd43987843626ffe08c2f0/CWL-sponsorship-agreement--signed-by-all.pdf),
CWL is a [direct
project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiscal_sponsorship#Table_comparing_the_models)
of SFC: CWL is owned by SFC, and the project's work is implemented by
SFC employees, volunteers, and contractors. Therefore this policy exists to document
that requirement and how we will manage it.

## Implementation

This section documents how an entity (the Properser) submitting grants
that involve Common Workflow Language standards (CWL) and the CWL
Project should seek approval for their proposal from the CWL Leadership team and
SFC.

1.  If a proposal
    a) indicates the use of CWL
    b) but will *not* be contributing substantially to the CWL Project (e.g. code, documentation, tutorials),
    c) and is not submitted in the name of the CWL project.
    then **Proposal approval is not needed**.
      * If the proposed grant is funded, please consider adding (if allowed)
        your proposal [to the list of projects](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwl-website/blob/main/content/_data/user-gallery.yml)
        using CWL and publicly [announce the funded grant on the CWL forum](https://cwl.discourse.group/c/announcements/6).
2.  For a proposal that indicates substantial contributions to the CWL Project,
    and/or is in the name of the CWL Project, then there are two paths
       *  The recommended path is co-develop a proposal with the CWL Leadership Team
          (and others); and for submission by SFC itself. Please contact SFC & the CWL
          leadership as soon as possible by emailing [commonworkflowlanguage\@sfconservancy.org](mailto:commonworkflowlanguage@sfconservancy.org)
          with an initial description of the grant proposal.
       *  If the SFC is ineligible to apply for this opportunity, or there is
          another good reason why an external entity should submit instead of SFC,
          then approval by the CWL Leadership Team *is* needed **and**
          justification for not submitting via SFC is required.
           * The Proposer will document and explain why the Proposal can not be
             sent by SFC; for example due to geographic or entity type restrictions.
           * The Proposer will supply the aims of the grants, total grant budget
             and duration.
           * The Proposer will supply a form (modeled after [this](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/6d/GLAM_partnership_evaluation_handout.pdf)
             form by the Wikimedia Foundation) to explain the benefits and
             risks of the proposed contributions to the CWL Project.
           * The aims and form will be due 2 weeks before any Letter of Support
             (LOS) is needed and should be sent to the leadership team <commonworkflowlanguage@sfconservancy.org>.
             A default LOS will be used unless otherwise requested by the Propser.
                * The members of the CWL Leadership Team will keep information
                  about grants that are not funded under a reasonable
                  expectation of privacy
           * Note that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (e.g.
             <https://nonprofitdocuments.law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/Collaboration-MOU-checklist-SLS-sample-07-05-17.pdf>)
             between SFC and the Proposers will need to be developed and signed;
             plan your time accordingly.
       * If the Proposal is funded, it is required to publicly announce the
         funded grant on the CWL forum (including the main aims) and link to
         the proposal (if it is possible to make publicly available)

For all these proposal options, Common Workflow Language should be cited
using the [proper up-to-date citations](https://www.commonwl.org/specification/#references).
